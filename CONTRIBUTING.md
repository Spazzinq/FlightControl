# Contribution Guidelines

Hey, if you're interested in contributing to FlightControl, then you've come to the right place.

If you haven't already, please join [the Discord](https://geofang.com/discord). It's vital for communication.

Firstly, here are some important references:

  * [Upcoming features](https://github.com/Spazzinq/FlightControl/projects/1) tells you where we're headed,
  * [Bugs](https://github.com/Spazzinq/FlightControl/projects/2) lists everything that seems to be going wrong, and
  * [Spigot Stash](https://hub.spigotmc.org/stash/projects/SPIGOT) provides access to the actual Spigot code.

## Testing

When adding a feature, please ensure that your ultimate goal is code that *works without bugs*.

## Submitting changes

Please create a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/Spazzinq/FlightControl/pulls) with a **clear** list of what you've done ([read more about pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/).

Write a clear log message for your commits--bigger changes should be more descriptive.

    $ git commit -m "Brief commit summary
    > 
    > For bigger changes, describe what changed and its impact here."

## Coding conventions

Reading the current code works too, but this is more concrete.
  * ***Focus on readability and maintainability!*** Remember that other people work on this project too!
  * Follow [Google's Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s3.3.1-wildcard-imports). There may be a few exceptions to its rules, but for the most part, the code complies.

Thank you for reading the contribution guidelines! Now you're ready to contribute :)
